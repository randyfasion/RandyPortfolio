# 02 Advanced CSS: My Portfolio 

## Task

In this Portfolio I am showcasing my skill sets to potential employers looking to fill a full-time position. I have highlighted my strongest work thus far, this Portfolio is a deployed Webb application with a live link to the direct Website. 

The webb applications displayed so far are:
    -Horiseon Homework 1 application
    -Scratch game application
    -"About Me" application

**Horiseon Application**

    -In this excercise I improved the html code without changing what the website does. For this particular assignment a "marketing agency" hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. 

    -I changed all the <div> tags in the html to another tag that will keep the current website formating. 

    -Then made the corresponding changes to the css file.

 -For example: for the header portion of the page. The <div> tag was changed to <header>, etc. 

 **Scratch game**

    -In this excercise I made an interactive game called "Get the cheesy puff."

    -Directions for the game includes:

        Start the game by clicking the green flag. Use the arrow keys to move the cat around the screen to catch the orange puff. After the score reaches 10, YOU WIN! Click the flag again to reload game. Red to stop.

**About Me**

    -In this excerceise I edited an "About Me" file to include some details about myself, then succesfully pushed all changed to my GitHub repository. 

        -This site includes sections like: 
            Introduction
            Where I'm from?
            What are my favorite hobbies?
            What's my dream job?
            Where do you live?
            Why do I want to be a Webb Developer? 

## Getting Started

**Portfolio**
    -Underneath the hood of my Portfolio I used a variety of tags, and a css file to create the formatting necessary for this site. 

        -The header of my page includes my title, picture, and links to the different sections of my page. 
        
        -Followed by my "About me" bio.

        -Then I have my three labeled picture links to my deployed applications. 
        
        -Lastly followed by my contact information, with a link to my GitHub account.
