# 02 Advanced CSS: My Portfolio 

## Task

In this Portfolio I am showcasing my skill sets to potential employers looking to fill a full-time position. I have highlighted my strongest work thus far, this Portfolio is a deployed Webb application with a live link to the direct Website. 

The webb applications displayed so far are:

-Horiseon Homework 1 application

-Work Day Scheduler application

-Password Generator application

**Horiseon Application**

    -In this excercise I improved the html code without changing what the website does. For this particular assignment a "marketing agency" hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. 

    -I changed all the <div> tags in the html to another tag that will keep the current website formating. 

    -Then made the corresponding changes to the css file.

    -For example: for the header portion of the page. The <div> tag was changed to <header>, etc. 

 **Work Day Scheduler**

    -In this application I created a calendar that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code.

    - I used the Momentjs library to work with the date and time. 

**Password Generator**

    -In this application I modified starter code to enable users to generate random passwords. Users are prompted to select criteria that they want their password to have.  

    -It features HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

## Getting Started

**Portfolio**
    -Underneath the hood of my Portfolio I used HTML, CSS, along with a variety of tags, and a css file to create the formatting necessary for this site. 

        -The header of my page includes my title, picture, and links to the different sections of my page. 
        
        -Followed by my "About me" bio.

        -Then I have three labeled picture links to my deployed applications, and links to the GitHub Repositories. 
        
        -Lastly followed by my contact information, with a link to my GitHub account.
