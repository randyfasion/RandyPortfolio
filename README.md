```

 **Work Day Scheduler**

    -In this application I created a calendar that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code.

    - I used the Momentjs library to work with the date and time. 

**Password Generator**

    -In this application I modified starter code to enable users to generate random passwords. Users are prompted to select criteria that they want their password to have.  

    -It features HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

## Getting Started

**Portfolio**
    -Underneath the hood of my Portfolio I used HTML, CSS, along with a variety of tags, and a css file to create the formatting necessary for this site. 

        -The header of my page includes my title, picture, and links to the different sections of my page. 
        
        -Followed by my "About me" bio.

        -Then I have three labeled picture links to my deployed applications, and links to the GitHub Repositories. 
        
        -Lastly followed by my contact information, with a link to my GitHub account.
